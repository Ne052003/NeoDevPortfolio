        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Back-End Developer specialized in Java development and always ready to take on new challenges. I
            specialize in creating and maintaining efficient and scalable software systems. I excel at problem-solving,
            quickly adapting to new technologies, and continuously improving my skills. I enjoy tackling technical
            challenges and collaborating in team environments to develop innovative solutions.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Professional Experience and Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>Provided support in maintaining and optimizing clinical and administrative applications developed with Power
            Builder and SQL. Identified and resolved software issues, improving system stability and performance.
            Additionally, I strengthened my debugging and database analysis skills in a professional environment.</p>

        <p>Participated in software development projects, applying the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from
            planning to deployment. Designed class diagrams, relational models, and entity-relationship diagrams to
            define system architecture and optimize data structures. Strengthened my knowledge in Object-Oriented
            Programming (OOP) using Java, C#, and PHP, and worked with SQL databases in MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

            <h3>Yeralitas Program</h3>
            <p>Yeralitas Program is a desktop application designed for efficient data management using Java Swing for
                the
                graphical interface, JDBC for database connectivity, and SQL Server as the backend. Built following the
                MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the application ensures a well-structured and scalable
                codebase.

                With CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, users can interact with the database seamlessly,
                allowing for record management, data retrieval, and modifications through an intuitive and user-friendly
                interface.<br /><br />

                This project showcases backend development skills, database management, and GUI design while adhering to
                industry best practices.</p>

            <h3>Task Manager API</h3>
            <p>A software project designed to efficiently manage users' pending tasks. Developed in Java, it follows a
                RESTful architecture using Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Spring Data for secure and scalable backend
                operations. <br />The system integrates a MySQL database for data storage and management. This project
                follows best development practices, including SOLID principles and code refactoring,
                ensuring maintainability and clean architecture.</p>

            <h3>Snake Desk</h3>
            <p>SnakeDesk is a version of the classic snake game, developed as a desktop application in Java using
                JavaFX. The goal is to control a snake that grows by eating food while avoiding collisions with the
                edges and itself.<br /> <br />

                The game features a simple graphical interface (JavaFX), intuitive controls, and smooth mechanics,
                ensuring a nostalgic and fun experience. It is built following best coding practices, leveraging
                object-oriented programming (OOP) and structured development.</p>

            <h3>Library Online</h3>
            <p>Bookstore API is a robust and scalable backend system designed to manage an online bookstore efficiently.
                The API provides essential functionalities, including user authentication, book management and billing.
                It follows best practices in software development, ensuring security,
                maintainability, and scalability through a modular architecture and industry-standard tools.<br /><br />

                The project implements JWT-based authentication for secure user access, role-based authorization to
                distinguish between customers and administrators, and RESTful API design for seamless integration with
                frontend applications. Additionally, database interactions are optimized using Hibernate (JPA), and the
                system supports CRUD operations for books, users, and bills.<br /><br />

                This API is built to be easily extendable, allowing future enhancements such as book cover image
                management, notifications, and advanced reporting.</p>
